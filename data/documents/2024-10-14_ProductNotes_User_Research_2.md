# ProductNotes - User Research (2)

> Topic: **ProductNotes**  |  Focus: **User Research**

## Notes

- Define success metric before building features.
- Use a counterfactual: what would users do otherwise?
- Prefer leading indicators (activation) over vanity metrics.

### Mini example
Metrics:
- Activation rate = users who reach "Aha moment" / signups
- Retention = cohort-based D1/D7
A/B testing: guard against novelty effects; pre-register success metrics.
