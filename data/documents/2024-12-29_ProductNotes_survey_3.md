# ProductNotes - 用户调研（3）

> Topic: **ProductNotes**  |  Focus: **User Research**

## Notes

- Define success metric before building features.
- Use a counterfactual: what would users do otherwise?
- Prefer leading indicators (activation) over vanity metrics.

### Mini example
Metrics:
- Activation rate = users who reach "Aha moment" / signups
- Retention = cohort-based D1/D7
A/B testing: guard against novelty effects; pre-register success metrics.

### Quick Q&A
**Q:** What should I remember about *User Research*?
**A:** Summarize it in 1 sentence, then link related notes. Start from the cluster and drill down.

### Table
| Item | Pros | Cons |

| Lexical search (BM25) | Fast, explainable | Misses paraphrases |
| Semantic search (embeddings) | Finds similar meaning | More compute |
| Hybrid | Best of both | Needs tuning |
